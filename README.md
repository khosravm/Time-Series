    A time series is a series of data points listed in time order. 
    On the other hand, preprocessing and analyzing time series is a crucial step 
    that helps enhance its quality to promote the extraction of meaningful insights 
    from the it. Here, we have a look some python methods for:
    
    - Import Time Series
    - Visualizing a Time Series
    - Patterns in a Time Series
    - Additive and multiplicative Time Series
    - Decompose a Time Series into its components
    - Stationary and non-stationary Time Series
    - Detrend a Time Series
    - Seasonality of a Time Series and deseasonalizing
    - Treat missing values 
    - Autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions
    - Estimate the forecastability of a Time Series
    - Granger Causality test 
    - Frequency and resampling
    - Rolling method
